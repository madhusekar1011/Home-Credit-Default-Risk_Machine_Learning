Home Credit addresses loan accessibility challenges for individuals with limited
credit history who often face predatory lending. Using a comprehensive Kaggle
dataset containing customer credit information, applications, and transactions, we developed machine learning models to classify borrowers as defaulters or nondefaulters.
The project employs systematic data analysis and feature engineering,
implementing various algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest. Our
goal is to accurately predict repayment capabilities, ensuring qualified borrowers
receive appropriate loan terms while minimizing default risks.
